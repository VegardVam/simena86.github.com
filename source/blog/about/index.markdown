<h3>About the website</h3>
Most of the time I have some kind of project going on, related to programming, electronics or some school project. I started this webproject with the purpose of having a place to dump my projects when I finished them, with the intent to keep them organized and prevent them from living a life in eternal oblivion. Lastly it might give me a chance to have a blog-like web page and actually get away with it.
