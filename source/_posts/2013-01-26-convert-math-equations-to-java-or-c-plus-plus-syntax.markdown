When writing programs that uses alot of math equations, e.g. in simulations, animations etc I found it tiresome to have to convert equations I got from symbolic math software like Maxima and Maple into c++ or java syntax. I therefor wrote a simple JavaScript that does this automatically, and can be found [here](/blog/math2javacpp/ ). The source is available at [github](https://github.com/simena86/math2javacpp "Math2javacpp") .
