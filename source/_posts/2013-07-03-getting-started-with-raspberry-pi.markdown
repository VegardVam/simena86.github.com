Raspbian
----------

For installing raspbian I've found great help in the following pages:

* [Install without keyboard and mouse by Vasco Pinho ](http://www.vascop.com/install-raspbian-and-configure-wi-fi-without-a-monitor-or-keyboard.html)
* [Install Raspbian Wheezy Linux to Raspberry Pi using Linux by Christos Manios](http://cmanios.wordpress.com/2013/03/10/install-raspbian-wheezy-linux-to-raspberry-pi-using-linux/)

And after some trouble with the wifi I found great help in this post:
* [PINGBIN](http://pingbin.com/2012/12/setup-wifi-raspberry-pi/)

Other tips and tricks

I followed [this guide](http://mitchtech.net/vnc-setup-on-raspberry-pi-from-ubuntu/) for setting up the pi for using a laptop as both remote monitor and keyboard!
